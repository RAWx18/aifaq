# Multi-Agent RAG Architecture for AIFAQ

This module implements a multi-agent framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in the AIFAQ system. The architecture divides responsibilities among specialized agents to improve the overall quality of responses.

## Agent Roles

1. **Query Understanding Agent**: Analyzes user queries to identify intent, context requirements, and keywords
2. **Retrieval Agent**: Manages document retrieval and relevance scoring
3. **Context Integration Agent**: Combines retrieved documents with conversation history
4. **Response Generation Agent**: Creates the final response using the prepared context
5. **Evaluation Agent**: Assesses response quality and provides feedback for improvement

## Implementation

The multi-agent system uses a coordinator to manage agent interactions and ensure a smooth workflow from query to response.

## Usage

The multi-agent system integrates with the existing RAG pipeline, providing enhanced capabilities without disrupting the current user experience.
